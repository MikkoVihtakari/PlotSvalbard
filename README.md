# PlotSvalbard

**Plot research data from Svalbard on maps. R package version 0.9.2.**

**NOTE:** Development of PlotSvalbard has been ended and moved to a new
improved versions of the package:
[**ggOceanMaps**](https://mikkovihtakari.github.io/ggOceanMaps/) (maps) 
and [**ggOceanPlots**](https://github.com/MikkoVihtakari/ggOceanPlots) 
(other plots). Please use those packages if you do not need functions 
that are not included in those ggOceanMaps/Plots. If you wish a
particular function moved from here to the maintained packages, please 
send an email to the developer. Support for keeping PlotSvalbard running
on new versions of R is still maintained. Please send bug-reports to the
maintainer if you encounter difficulties with PlotSvalbard. Bug reports
are encouraged to be sent on
[GitHub](https://github.com/MikkoVihtakari/PlotSvalbard/issues).
Remember a reproducible example ;)

## Overview

This package provides functions to plot research data from Svalbard on
detailed and up-to-date maps that are not available in online databases.
The package was developed by the Norwegian Polar Institute. Glacier
fronts and land shapes of Kongsfjorden originate from July 2017. Note
that the package comes with absolutely no warranty and that maps
generated by the package might be wrong. Any bug reports and code fixes
are warmly welcomed. See *Contributions and contact information* for
further details. **PlotSvalbard** is based on
[**ggplot2**](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/) and the functions
can be expanded using ggplot syntax.

## Installation

PlotSvalbard is not available in CRAN due to package size limitations.
The package can be installed using the
[**devtools**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html)
package. Recently, there has been many reports with PlotSvalbard
installation failing because the `install_github` function attempts to
update installed packages and fails. Try following steps:

1.  Manually update all R packages you have installed (Packages -\>
    Update -\> Select all -\> Install updates in R Studio).
2.  If update of a package fails, try installing that package again
    using the `install.packages` function or the R Studio menu.
3.  Run following:
    `devtools::install_github("MikkoVihtakari/PlotSvalbard", upgrade =
    "never")`
4.  If installation of a dependency fails, try installing that package
    manually and repeat step 2.

## Usage

**PlotSvalbard** extends on
[**ggplot2**](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/). Data that
contains geographic information can be plotted on these maps using the
ggplot2 layers separated by the `+` operator.

### Website and user manual

Detailed documentation on how to use the package can be found from the
[website](https://mikkovihtakari.github.io/PlotSvalbard/index.html)
including [an organized list of
functions](https://mikkovihtakari.github.io/PlotSvalbard/reference/index.html)
included in the package and [the user
manual](https://mikkovihtakari.github.io/PlotSvalbard/articles/PlotSvalbard.html).

#### Making a map with text

``` r
library(PlotSvalbard)

data("kongsfjord_moorings")

basemap("kongsfjorden", limits = c(11.3, 12.69, 78.86, 79.1), round.lat = 0.05, round.lon = 0.5) + 
geom_text(data = kongsfjord_moorings,
  aes(x = lon.utm, y = lat.utm, label = Mooring.name, color = Name), 
  fontface = 2, size = 25.4/72.27*8) # font size = 8, see Graphical parameters
```

#### Barents Sea ocean-current arrows

``` r
basemap("barentssea", bathymetry = TRUE, currents = TRUE, current.size = "scaled")
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Pan-Arctic maps

``` r
basemap("panarctic", bathymetry = TRUE)
```

#### Combining extensions for ggplot2

Most extensions for ggplot2 work together with PlotSvalbard.

``` r
data(zooplankton)

x <- transform_coord(zooplankton, lon = "Longitude", lat = "Latitude", bind = TRUE)

species <- colnames(x)[!colnames(x) %in% c("lon.utm", "lat.utm", "ID", "Longitude", "Latitude", "Total")]

library(scatterpie)

basemap("barentssea", limits = c(4, 24, 79.5, 83.5), round.lon = 2, round.lat = 1) +
geom_scatterpie(aes(x = lon.utm, y = lat.utm, group = ID, r = 100*Total), data = x, cols = species, size = 0.1) +
scale_fill_discrete(name = "Species", breaks = species, 
labels = parse(text = paste0("italic(" , sub("*\\.", "~", species), ")")))
```

## News

2020-04-09 Updated to v0.9. Many changes and improvements. Taking first
steps to prepare for CRAN release under a different name (the package
will be renamed ggOceanMaps). Trying to make all functionality stable
before the shift. This update may well have broken something.

2019-02-11 Updated to v0.8. PlotSvalbard can now make maps of any region
north of 30 degrees latitude. **REMOVED arctic50 and arctic60** map
types and replaced these by basemap(“panarctic”, limits = 50) (or any
integer between 30 and 88). Automatic limits should now work for all map
types.

2018-12-18 Updated to v0.7. Added interpolation for oceanographic
section plots together with a function that produces such plots using
ggplot2. Renamed the previous `interpolate` function, which performed
spatial interpolation to `interpolate_spatial`. Added possibility to
adjust legend positions to `basemap`. Improved Barents Sea current arrow
plotting. The new functions are still relatively unstable and introduce
more dependencies. Please report if you do not manage to install the new
version of PlotSvalbard. The situation will be improved in the future
updates.
